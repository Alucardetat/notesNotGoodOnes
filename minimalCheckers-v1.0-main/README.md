# minimalCheckers-v1.0
This is my final project for JavaScript in my learning with Persevere.

The goal is a minimalistc, and elegent Checkers game.

While there are many differnt Rules variations for Checkers , which is also known as Draughts.

- Suicide Checkers
- International Draughts (also known as "Flying Kings")
- Canadian Checkers
- Bazilian Checkers
- Italian Checkers

This project will be using standard International Rules.

Contrary to popular belief, Chinese Checkers isn't actually a Rule variation of Checkers. It is played on a star chaped board and played using marbles or pegs.
